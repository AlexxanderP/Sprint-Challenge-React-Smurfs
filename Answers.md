1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Some of the differences between Server side and Client side routing include: Server-side routing reloads the page changing the URL to match the request and loading what is requested and only that, giving forth the opprotunity to load smaller portions of the webpage instead of having to request and load the whole site at once, however can be a disadvantage due to the process having to run through a lot of protocols, which can be slow during cases such as having low bandwith.

    Client-side routing is handled all internally by the JS that is already on the page, making the need for the page to refresh every time obsolete, once the information is requested component-based architecture allows the resource that is already available to us to be rendered out. it is also the main method that is used now.
